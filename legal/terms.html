We do not sell a business opportunity, “get rich quick” program, guaranteed system, franchise system, or a business in a box. You should not purchase our services or products if that is your expectation.

THE WEBSITE AND THE MATERIALS, INFORMATION, AND SERVICES CONTAINED AND OFFERED ON THE WEBSITE ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS”, AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

SECTION 10 – LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITIES

EXCEPT WHERE OTHERWISE INAPPLICABLE OR PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO CASE SHALL McClean Leads, OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, AGENTS, CONTRACTORS, SUPPLIERS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INJURY, LOSS, CLAIM, OR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUE, LOST SAVINGS, LOSS OF DATA, REPLACEMENT COSTS, OR ANY SIMILAR DAMAGES, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM YOUR OR YOUR BUSINESS’S USE OR ATTEMPTED USE OF ANY PART OF THE WEBSITE OR ANY SERVICES, OR FOR ANY OTHER CLAIM RELATED IN ANY WAY TO YOUR OR YOUR BUSINESS’S USE OR ATTEMPTED USE OF THE WEBSITE OR ANY SERVICE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN ANY CONTENT, OR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF THE WEBSITE OR ANY CONTENT OR SERVICE POSTED, TRANSMITTED, OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THEIR POSSIBILITY.

IF, NOTWITHSTANDING THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SET FORTH ABOVE, McClean Leads IS FOUND LIABLE UNDER ANY THEORY, McClean Leads’S

 LIABILITY AND YOUR AND YOUR BUSINESS’S EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE LESSER OF (I) USD $1,000.00, OR (II) THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU OR YOUR BUSINESS PAID TO McClean Leads IN THE ONE (1) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE INCIDENT ON WHICH YOUR OR YOUR BUSINESS’S ALLEGED CLAIM IS BASED. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY FOR ALL CLAIMS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER McClean Leads WAS AWARE OF OR ADVISED IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGES OR SUCH CLAIMS. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES, SO SOME OF THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU OR YOUR BUSINESS.


SECTION 11 – DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER

PLEASE READ THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND YOUR AND YOUR BUSINESS’S RIGHTS. EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY LAW, YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM THAT YOU OR YOUR BUSINESS MAY HAVE IN THE FUTURE MUST BE RESOLVED THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION. YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY. THE RIGHTS THAT YOU OR YOUR BUSINESS WOULD HAVE IF YOU OR YOUR BUSINESS WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS DISCOVERY OR THE RIGHT TO APPEAL, MAY BE MORE LIMITED OR MAY NOT EXIST. YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS AGREE TO ONLY BRING A CLAIM IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF(LEAD OR OTHERWISE) OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS FURTHER AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OR CLAIMS OR OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.


THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. HOWEVER, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT(INCLUDING INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF OR STATUTORY DAMAGES), AND MUST FOLLOW THESE TERMS OF USE AS A COURT WOULD.

 

If you or your business has a complaint, dispute, or controversy, you and your business agree to first contact us at legal@mccleanleads.com to attempt to resolve the dispute or controversy informally. Any controversy or claim arising out of or related to the use of the Website, any service, product, or information, or your and your business’s relationship with us that cannot be resolved through such informal process or through negotiation within 120 days shall be resolved by binding, confidential arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association(“AAA”), and judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. We agree that any claim we may have against you or your business will also be subject to this arbitration provision, except as provided in Sections 12 and 13 below. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator in the English language in Austin, Texas, unless we both agree to conduct the arbitration by telephone or written submissions. The arbitrator shall be selected by agreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, chosen in accordance with the Rules of the AAA. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of theAAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures, in effect at the time of submission of the demand for arbitration. The AAA’s Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, construction, validity, applicability, or enforceability of these Terms of Use, the Privacy Policy, this arbitration provision, and any other terms incorporated by reference into these Terms of Use. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether any dispute is arbitrable. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether this arbitration agreement can be enforced against a non-signatory to this agreement and whether a non-signatory to this agreement can enforce this provision against you, your business or McClean Leads LLC. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s Rules. In all other respects, and regardless of which party partially or fully prevails, the parties shall each pay their own additional fees, costs, and expenses, including, but not limited to, those for any attorneys, experts, documents, and witnesses.


The arbitrator shall follow the substantive law of the State of Texas without regard to its conflicts of laws principles. Any award rendered shall include a confidential written opinion and shall be final, subject to appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, as amended. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.


You, your business, and McClean Leads LLC agree that disputes will only be arbitrated on an individual basis and shall not be consolidated on a class-wide or other representative basis, nor consolidated with any other arbitration(s) or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party. You, your business, and McClean Leads LLC expressly waive any right to pursue any class or other representative action against each other. Failure or any delay in enforcing this arbitration provision in connection with any particular claim will not constitute a waiver of any rights to require arbitration at a later time or in connection with any other claims except that all claims must be brought within 1 year after the claim arises (the 1 year period includes the 120-day informal resolution procedures described above).


This arbitration provision sets forth the terms and conditions of our agreement to final and binding confidential arbitration and is governed by and enforceable under the Federal ArbitrationAct, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, as amended. 


This provision survives termination of your account or relationship with McClean Leads LLC, bankruptcy, assignment, or transfer. If the class action waiver is deemed unenforceable ( i.e., unenforceability would allow arbitration to proceed as a class or representative action), then this entire arbitration provision shall be rendered null and void and shall not apply. If a portion of this arbitration provision (other than the class action waiver) is deemed unenforceable, the remaining portions of this arbitration provision shall remain in full force and effect.


YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO LITIGATE THROUGH A COURT, TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE, AND TO BE PARTY TO A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. HOWEVER, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS DECIDED INDIVIDUALLY AND ONLY THROUGH BINDING, FINAL, AND CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION. Should either party file an action contrary to this provision, the other party may recover attorney’s fees and costs up to $5,000.00.

SECTION 12 – McClean Leads LLC’S ADDITIONAL REMEDIES

In order to prevent or limit irreparable injury to McClean Leads LLC, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by you or your business of the provisions of this Agreement or any infringement or threatened infringement by you or your business of the intellectual property of McClean Leads LLC or a third-party, McClean Leads LLC shall be entitled to seek a temporary restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunctions or other equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction located in Austin, Texas enjoining such breach, threatened breach, infringement, or threatened infringement. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as prohibiting McClean Leads LLC from pursuing in court any other remedies available to it for such breach, threatened breach, infringement, or threatened infringement, including the recovery of monetary damages from you and your business. You and your business hereby irrevocably consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of, and exclusive venue in, the courts of Austin, Texas for all such claims, and forever waive any challenge to said courts’ exclusive jurisdiction or venue.

A waiver of any right or obligation under this Agreement shall only be effective if in writing and signed by McClean Leads LLC.  

SECTION 18 – GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE
