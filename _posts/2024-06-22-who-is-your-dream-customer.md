If you’re not fired up to serve, it’s because you don’t care for your clients. 

Allow me to explain, 

Flipping through DotCom Secrets by Russel Brusnon, I came across this story he shared that made sooo much sense to me. 

He tells a story about how he woke up one Monday morning, sick to his stomach. 

Wishing he had a boss that could fire him. 

And the kicker, he was balling! He was making more money than most people could imagine. 

Then, after talking with his mentor, he realized that he didn’t like his customers. And that it wasn’t his customers fault, it was his own fault. 

He talked about how he had all of this advanced information that he wanted to share with people, but the clients he had were all beginners, just getting started. And how he was spending 99% of his time helping them get set up with some of the most remedial, mundane tasks. 

And his mentor told him, if you want different clients, then you need to change the bait. 

And Russel talks about how it dawned on him that he was just throwing bait in the water and catching whatever he could get. 

And as a result, he was catching things he didn’t want. 

He realized that in order to catch the kind of people he wanted, he needed to consider what kind of people they were. 

And he goes on to talk about how important it is to write out who your dream customer is. 

And a light bulb went off for me right there. 

I looked back into the past and realized any job that I was ever at and hated because I didn’t like the customers I was dealing with. 

But that wasn’t their fault. That was my fault. I was settling for a quick buck, just trying to make some money. 

I didn’t stop to think about what kind of people I wanted to be around and what characteristics they had and what places they would congregate at. In retrospect, DUH! 

But, if you’re out there listening to this, I highly recommend you take this advice. Take a moment to draft out your DREAM customer. Someone you would LOVE to wake up and serve. Someone you would love to see succeed. Watch how that little exercise starts shaping the direction you go in.
