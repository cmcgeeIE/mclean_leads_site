In the early stages of any business, the path of least resistance might seem appealing. However, a journey with my lead generation agency taught me that sometimes, the easier option isn't always the best. 

When starting out, it's crucial to work with clients who align with your vision, capabilities, and standards, rather than trying to mold unrelated prospects to fit your business model.

When I launched my agency, I chose to work with someone familiar to me. 

Despite his company’s focus on residential projects, I was optimistic that pivoting them towards commercial clients would turn out great. 

The familiar relationship and apparent ease of access I had through my contact distracted me from the foundational mismatches between our goals.

Despite the initial enthusiasm from my contact, it soon became clear that his willingness to pivot into commercial projects was way different from his business partner/chief sales officer’s willingness. 

I thought my contact was the main person that needed to be on board to make our partnership work, but it turned out his partner/CSO was the main person that needed to be on board with this commercial pivot. 

And while the CFO was initially agreeable, something felt off. His words said “Let’s do it.”, while his tone and demeanor said “I don’t want to.”

Looking back on it, I knew something was off during our demo call, but I let optimism and familiarity get in the way of seeing the obvious truth right in front of me. 

I’d like to say that I picked up on this disinterest immediately and decided it would be best for us to part ways for the time being, but I didn’t do that. Instead, I chugged along and committed to making our partnership work. And as a result, I paid the price of ignorance. 

The CSO, who was crucial to the success of the operation, failed to communicate effectively. Once it was just him and I on the on-boarding call and my familiar contact was no longer involved, his attitude changed. His enthusiasm was non-existent. I pushed forward anyway, thinking his attitude might improve once we gained momentum.

So I set the emails up and started their 14-day warm-up process. And what do you know, this guy began ghosting me. After agreeing to review a video sales letter (VSL) script, he just didn’t reply. 

I offered to drive to him, shoot the video, edit it and everything, but he didn’t respond to my messages. The lack of engagement and the absence of essential marketing materials, like videos and case studies, took a toll on my faith in our partnership. 

Still, I thought, “Oh well. We’ll just work with what they have, and once we get some leads, then he’ll start communicating.”

And since the emails were taking 14-days to warm up, I redirected my efforts towards enhancing my own marketing materials and business standards. I revised my own sales script, invested time in enhancing the VSL with compelling visuals, and added special effects to make the presentation not just informative but also engaging. 

I researched the best practices of other businesses that were already focused on commercial deals. 

This boosted my faith SO much! It no longer felt like that time and effort were being thrown down the drain. This revamped approach wasn't just about salvaging a bad situation; it was about setting a standard for future engagements.

14 days passed, and I launched the campaign. I just knew that at least once I got a lead this CSO would see the value in my offer. 

Wrong! 

The realization of my delusion hit hard when a potential lead from a home renovation company showed interest in working with their company, only to be met with silence from the CSO. Talk about feeling dragged down. 

What had started out as a seemingly great idea, was At this point, I decided to reach out to my buddy from the beginning of this partnership, and he shed light on the challenges in their company, particularly concerning his CSO. 

Despite initial frustrations, our conversation led to a resolution, and the CSO finally got in contact with me. The conversation was professional, but the relationship was cooked.

I realized that continuing to work with their company wasn't the best course of action, but a tempting idea crept into my mind. What if my buddy replaced the ineffective CSO as their company’s new commercial sales rep?

We got along way better, and he showed clear interest, but I knew in my gut the likelihood for increased conflict and discord within their company was certain. 

Instead, I chose to stick to the lessons learned from the whole experience and focus on targeting commercial clients that already align with my agency's vision and standards. Reflecting on the journey, I've gained valuable insights that reshaped my approach to client selection and business dynamics.

The proximity and familiar connection led me to skip crucial early-stage discussions, such as a THOROUGH discovery call with the RIGHT team members—mistakes that cost time and effort. 

This situation highlighted the importance of aligning with clients who understand and value what you offer. 

Working with commercial providers from the start would have saved me from the one-sided effort of trying to convert a residential-focused business into a commercial one. 

Commercial providers already recognize their customer profiles, the dynamics of commercial dealings, and have the right marketing materials, which could have streamlined my processes significantly.

One significant realization is that, despite initial setbacks, working with someone familiar provided value in unexpected ways. 

See, while others were burning cash on their own email campaigns and then flushing even more down the drain with mismatched clients, I dodged that bullet. 

This journey taught me that optimism must be tempered with practicality. 

The best business decisions are based on logical qualifications and a clear understanding of each party's expectations and capabilities. 

For anyone starting out, remember: choose clients who not only need what you have but are also prepared to engage with it. 

It’s not just about finding any client; it’s about finding the right client.
