11 sectors, 25 industry groups, 74 industries and 163 sub-industries. 

These are the official business categories, according to The Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS). 

10 main sectors, 22 genre groups, 50 genres, over 100 sub-genres and modes. 

These are the types of video games available to play, according to a quick Google search.

Do you see the similarities?

Good.  

I’m bringing this to your attention to transform your perception of business.

To transform your perception from something obscure and intimidating, to something clear and enlightening. 

Going into business is no different than getting into a game.

There are different kinds, different characters, different skills, and different players. 


It’s up to you to figure out the business game created for users like you. 

How do you figure that out?

You already know the answer. 

Sample.

I’d listen to friends at the lunch table to see what games they enjoyed. 

I’d browse around the gaming store for games that looked interesting.

I’d overhear other kids at recess talking about different games.

Then, I’d go to the gaming store and rent a game. 

Rent. Not buy (at least not yet) 

That way I could play a game for a few days, and see if I enjoyed it. 

If I did, then I’d pay to keep the game. 

Eventually, you get a feel for what kind of games you like, and which ones you don’t. 


You figure out the kind of people who like games like you and gravitate towards them. 

The same is true for business. 

There’s so many different kinds out there. 

And you can rent/test them just like a video game. 

I guarantee there’s plenty out there for someone like you. 

It just takes some time to figure out what you like. 

Just like with gaming, you’re not stuck with that game forever. 

You can test out a new kind of job on the weekend, or at a different shift. 

You can simulate trading with fake money. 

You can test out designing a game. 

You can try out cold outreach. 

You can test out writing a book.

And you can do all of these things in a bite size manner --  just like renting a game. 

There’s no major, critical decision to make. 

It’s just a game/business to try out. 

If you don’t enjoy the business, then you return it. 

Or maybe you like the game, but not the character you created. 

In that case, you can keep the business and create a new character for yourself.  

Or maybe you mature, and the kind of businesses you used to like just don’t hit the same anymore. 

So you move on to a different genre. 

And the amazing thing is, you still keep all of the experience you gained. 

No matter what you play, the mechanics and understanding needed to play another game and create another character from scratch all transfers over in some way.  

The same applies for business. 

If your first one doesn’t turn out how you’d like, or it gets crushed, or your tastes change, you can play a different game again. 

And again. And again. And again. 

Playing a game isn’t intimidating whatsoever. 

It’s enjoyable. 

The same can be true for creating your business.
