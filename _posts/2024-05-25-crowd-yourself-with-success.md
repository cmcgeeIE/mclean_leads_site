Once in the vibrant city of Solaris, a place known for its sunshine and high spirits, lived an entrepreneur named Eli. 

Eli had a vision to harness the city’s abundant sunlight to power its farmers’ businesses through innovative solar technologies.

Eli was no ordinary dreamer; he was a doer. 

He spent his days and many a night: 

Sketching plans 
Strategizing 
Piecing together a business model that could truly make a difference. 

His garage became a sanctuary, littered with blueprints and marketing materials for "Eli’s Eco Energy," a venture he believed would light up his city. 

One fine morning, hyped by the latest motivational podcast and a hefty dose of caffeine, Eli decided it was time to launch his grand plan. 

He poured his savings into crafting the perfect pitch—a video sales letter that would surely captivate anyone who viewed it. 

He revamped his website to mirror the sleek, clean energy of his product, expecting a flood of inquiries and excitement as soon as the launch button was hit.

Days turned into weeks, and Eli watched and waited. 

The digital silence was deafening; the flood of interest was merely a trickle of “not interested”. 

Bruised but not defeated, Eli sought advice from a seasoned entrepreneur, Leorio, whose café he frequented for the strongest Wi-Fi and coffee in town.

“Eli,” Leorio said, his eyes twinkling with a mix of wisdom and nostalgia, “tell me, did you check how many farmers there are in Solaris?”

	“Volume negates luck.” - Alex Hormozi

Eli paused, his mind racing. 

In his rush to bring his dream to fruition, he had not validated whether there were enough farmers for his high-tech solar solutions in Solaris.

Leorio’’s question was a gentle but stark reminder of a crucial step he’d skipped.

Heeding Leorio’s advice, Eli set out to truly understand his potential addressable market. 

He used tools like Apollo to gather data on how many farmers in Solaris had the means of using his product. 

The results were sobering; the potential market was enthusiastic but numerically small—far smaller than Eli's imagination had painted.

Armed with this new knowledge, Eli pivoted. 

His offering stayed the same, but his target audience and messaging changed. 

Solaris and its neighboring cities hosted hundreds of thousands of restaurants with roofs ready for his solar solutions, so he targeted them instead.

Months later, Eli’s efforts began to bear juicy fruits. 

His business grew, not as a wild vine but as a well-tended garden, flourishing in the spaces where he had confirmed the soil was fertile.

Eli’s tale is a testament to the power of market validation. 

It's not merely about having a product but knowing that there is a large enough crowd waiting for it, eager and ready to appreciate it.

“Opportunity is a function of density. Get to a place that's crowded with success.” - Scott Galloway

This story, while a simple one, mirrors the journeys of many entrepreneurs who learn that success often comes to those who listen before they speak.

In the world of business, as in all of life’s quests, understanding the lay of the land is not just advantageous; it's essential. 

The lesson Eli learned is one we can all take to heart: validate your market, and make sure there’s enough customers available to guide you to success.

Here’s a raw truth from my personal storybook: I once zeroed in on servicing commercial solar businesses with my lead gen services, pouring hours into crafting a killer video sales letter, editing the video, revamping the website, the whole nine yards. 

But here’s the gut punch—I was playing in a sandbox with barely a few hundred leads.

A hard lesson in the harsh light of reality. 

But here’s the flip: all those hard-earned lessons are gold. 

They transfer, they scale.

For anyone just starting out, here’s my unsolicited advice: Don’t jump head-first into building your empire until you know there’s an army to hear your battle cry. 

How you validate the market is up to you. 

There’s plenty of ways. 

Customer interviews and surveys
Social media and forums
SEO and keyword research
Industry reports and market studies

In my case, I could have jumped into a lead gen tool like Apollo, looked up my target audience, and seen there were only a few hundred contacts available. 

(That’s what I ended up doing, but only after I had poured time and energy into creating marketing assets.)

Learn from other's mistakes. 

“One of the best ways to learn from mistakes is to learn from the mistakes of others. Learning from others' mistakes is cost-free” - Charlie Munger 

Validate the size of your market before you light the fires and kick off the heavy lifting. 

Get this right, and you’re not just working hard—you’re working smart.

Life is rich,
