Do it! Do it now! 

If you haven’t read the book Million Dollar Weekend by Noah Kagan, I highly recommend it. 

It’s one of those rare books where you feel the author's energy jumping off the page. 

(Feel free to pause right here, hop on Amazon, and at least put that thing in your shopping cart for later)

I bring up that book because I VIBE with Noah on a very particular point he makes. 

And it’s about the art of doing it now, not how.  

And that’s so helpful in life and business because (and I’m warning you here), if you get caught up in trying to figure out exactly “how” something is going to get done, then you’ll get paralyzed with thoughts.

100% guaranteed.  

I’m not sure exactly why that is (and I don’t need to know why), but I promise you that if you have a problem with “now”, then you will SUFFER. 

That doesn’t mean you have to commit to being married right here right now after you just went on the first date. 

It doesn’t mean anything like that. 

What it means is, if you’re interested in talking to someone, then just do it now. 

You may find out there an asshole in less than a second. 

And that’s no problem because it’s better to deal with an asshole in reality than psychologically torturing yourself by trying to figure out “how” you’re going to talk to them. 

If you have an idea for your business, get to it now. 

If you have an idea that can help your client get more business, then just do it now.

Just do what you can, right now. 

There’s always gonna be a gap in your knowledge when you’re doing something you’ve never done before. 

And this ties into asking for forgiveness and not permission as well because you will get caught up in trying to figure out “how” to ask for permission in just the perfect right way, and it just won’t get done. 

Now I hope that this message doesn’t get you overzealous. 

Thinking you can just do any and everything without any consequences, because there’s always some kind of consequence for whatever you do. 

But if you’re able to exercise that “now”: muscle, and combine it with more and more experience or discernment, then I promise you’lll escape that psychological torture chamber of “how”.

And by doing it “now” I DO NOT mean rushing or being impulsive. Rushing is speed mixed with worry. Being impulsive is acting without discernment. 

That is not the same thing as “now”. 

Now is absent of speed or time. 

It is whatever you call the present.

You can add speed into the equation if you want, but you can do things “now” and slowly or quickly. 

It doesn't matter. 

And remember, there will be consequences!

I just recommend you deal with them now….

Assuming you’re not doing something that is just absolutely unforgivable (I mean just evil af)...

Then do it now, find out, and ask for forgiveness if you need to. 

Especially in the beginning when you have low experience, you have so little to lose and so much to gain.
