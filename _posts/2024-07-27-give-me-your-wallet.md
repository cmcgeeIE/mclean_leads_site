“May I see your wallet?” she asked. 

He pulled it out of his pocket and handed it to her.

She flipped through his wallet, grabbed the cash, and smiled.

“You have happy money.” she said. 

“Your money was earned, spent, and shared in ways that contributed to peoples’ well-being.” 

I love that story in Ken Honda’s book “Happy Money”

If you haven’t checked it out, I highly recommend getting it. 

You, watching this, is your money happy? 

Or, nah? 

Is it anxious, and worried? Stressed out? 

Or does it like being around you? Does it like how you treat it? 

I was raised to view money as this slippery, elusive creature. 

As if it was always running away from my family and friends..

Trying to get the hell away from us by any means necessary…

As if money had something personal against us…

But, you needed it to survive. 

And it had to be captured and enslaved…

It’s fair to say, my programmed perception of money was set up in a way to make me resentful. 

As if money was a necessary evil. 

Abusive, poisonous, and mistreating me and my family. 

You know what’s interesting? 

Even when life changed and people around me earned a lot more money than I was used to, I still witnessed fear and sorrow overtaking some people, and joy and kindness living in others.  

I remember when my family moved from Tomball to McKinney Texas… 

I was stunned. 

The houses were BIG. 

The grass was green. 

The landscaping was beautiful. 

Up until that point, I do not remember seeing more beautiful neighborhoods than these. 

(And that was just what I saw from the outside).

After making friends, I started to see inside. 

Jaw dropping pantry’s filled to the brim with the snacks of your dreams…

Playing in backyards more spacious than other people’s entire homes…

Cannonballing into pristine underground pools…

Watching movies from leather recliners in luxurious home theaters…

Dining on butter-coated steaks and juicy shrimp…


At this point, I thought these people must be living on cloud 9 and money is DEFINITELY the reason why. 

But, I noticed something. 

A lot of the people in this new environment were different in that they had more money than the people I knew before.

Yet their insides were basically the same. 

When I lived in small apartments in rough areas, there were kind people and cruel people. 

The same rang true around people with more money. 

I thought a certain amount of money must be the solver of all things.

But I witnessed happy kids and depressed kids. 

Families dealing with the same things all families deal with. 


I remember being so confused that kids with pantries filled with sweet Fruit Gushers and salty snacks, having summer vacations galore, and the newest video games could still be unhappy with where they were in life.

I also remember being super sad about being wrong. 

I thought that money at this scale was the answer, and I was wrong.

But, at the same time, if you’ve even been broke before, you know that it sure is nice to have some money (hit that subscribe button if you can relate) 

So, what’s the deal? 

Is money good or bad? 

The fact of the matter is that money is neither.

As with damn near everything, it boils down to you and your relationship with it. 

In my experience, I’ve found that I love making money.

It feels GREAT.

But, only when certain criteria are met.

If it feels like I’m giving somebody something that’s going to hurt them in exchange for money, then I resent myself and the money I’ve earned. 

I don’t even want to spend the money on anything, I want to throw it in the trash or give it to someone else I think can “cleanse” it. 

On the other hand, iIf I feel like I’m giving somebody something that’s going to help and be appreciated, then I love myself and the money I’ve earned. 

I’m like this with a lot of things. 

For example, I love dogs, but right now, I don’t want to own one. 

Why? Because I can’t take care of it the way I want to. 

I want the dog to have a lot of space, be able to run outside whenever it wants to, eat well, and never be left alone in the house dependent on me to take it outside for a walk. 

I don’t want to take it to the spa and the doggy day care or anything like that. 

But, I want the dog to be able to roam around outside without causing any trouble…

And I don’t want to feel bad looking at it thinking to myself, “Damn. I’m so sorry I have you cooped up living this way.” 

That’s just my temperament. That’s my criteria for being a solid dog owner. 

It’s not about anyone else, it’s about what makes me feel like I’m doing well or not. 

The same applies for money. 

I want to feel like I’m doing something beneficial with it. 

Like I’m loving it and treating it right. 

Now, let’s have some fun with rapid fire questions. 

You’ve only got a few seconds to answer these. 

Imagine money was like a living creature, like a dog: 

What does that creature look like to you?
Does it look fierce and powerful? Whimsical? Cute and friendly?
How does it make you feel?
On a scale of 0 -10, 0 being a tea-cup chihuahua and 10 being a wolf, where do you rank this creature?
Do you believe you could take care of this thing?
What does taking care of it even mean to you?
Do you feel afraid that it’s going to desert you?
If it left, would you be like SpongeBob crying, “Please come home! I’m a wreck without you!”

(I love playing with ideas like this to get a good visual representation of what I’m dealing with, where I’m coming from.)

What’s really interesting about all this, is how malleable your perception of money can be.

Just because it’s stuck in a certain way, doesn’t mean you can’t pour some water on it (aka different ideas) and change it into something else. 

That’s just so fascinating to me. 


One last practical thing before I let you go, go pretend to buy something and then see how it makes you feel? Imagine to yourself, ooh what if I bought this right now, how would that make me feel? 

And pay attention to whether you’re filled with a pleasant, sustained energy, or if you feel nothing, or you feel a spike of energy that leaves after a little bit of time.

And do the same for an imaginary job, imagine ooh what if I provided something with this, how would that make me feel? And again, pay attention to the kind of energy you get and how long it lasts.  

Go with that pleasant, sustained energy flow. 

Till next time, 

Canaan
