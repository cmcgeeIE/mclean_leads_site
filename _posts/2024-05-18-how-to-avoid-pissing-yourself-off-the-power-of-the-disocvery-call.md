You lose when you don’t know who you’re trying to help. 

I know a guy who went out of his way to help someone. 

He had the best of intentions too. 

But, he didn’t know who he was helping. 

What I mean by that is this, he didn’t speak with the person he was trying to help before offering his help.

He went out of his way to use his own time and resources to get a logo created for a business owner. . . without first talking to the business owner.

This guy was so excited! 

The logo was beautiful. 

Modern. 

It looked great.

He even shared it with his friends and people close to the business owner. 

They all liked it.

So, he finally talked with the business owner and presented the logo to him. 

“Hey! I got this new logo for you! What do you think? :)”

“Oh? A new logo?”, the owner said, surprised. 

The owner checked it out, smiled, said thanks, and politely rejected his offering.  

The guy was surprised. Confused. Offended. 

“What the f*ck? His logo is ugly, and I took my own time and energy to get a professional logo created for him, and he’s not even going to use it?!?”

Can you see what happened? 

It wasn’t that the new logo looked bad. It looked nice actually. 

He tried so hard.

And got so far.

But in the end, it didn’t even matter.

Why? Because he skipped the discovery phase.

Had the guy first talked with the owner before going to work, he would have discovered that this logo held a lot of sentimental value and had a lot of effort tied into it. 

The business owner already liked how his current logo looked. . . 

The logo included an image of his most precious loved one. . . 
 
And he spent hours toiling over the computer to create the logo himself. . . 

And he used that logo on all of the business apparel he paid for. . . 

And he used that logo on his business cards. . . 

And he used it all on his website. . .

And all of his social media platforms. . .

You get the idea.

This new logo wasn’t a pleasant gift to the owner whatsoever. 

It was quite the opposite.

“What’s wrong with the logo I have now? Did I ask for a new one? Who does this guy think he is? Is this his way of telling me my logo’s bad? Does he have any idea how long it would take me to update all my stuff? Does he know how much it would cost me? Does he know how much this logo means to me? Is he serious? Wtf? He’s pissin’ me off, but let me not be rude though. He’s just an amateur.  I’ll just smile, say thanks, but no thanks -- and send him on his way.” 

If there was a neuralink plugged inside his head at the time, I’d bet you’d see those were some of the business owners' thoughts when the guy “gifted” him a new logo he didn’t ask for, want, or need. 

What was perceived as helpful to the guy who worked on the new logo, was perceived as inconsiderate and burdensome to the business owner. 

Talk about unintended side effects. 

Moral of the story:

“If you neglect the discovery call, then suffer and die.”

The discovery call is that conversation you have with someone to determine if they’re a good fit for the product/service you’d like to offer them. 

Here’s some useful questions the guy could’ve asked upfront before doing all that work, for example: 

Do you have any interest in a new logo? 
What’s the story behind your current logo? 
What do you look for in a logo?  

Had this guy taken a few minutes to speak with the business owner and ask him some questions before building a brand new logo, he might have realized that working on a new logo was a complete waste because the business owner had no pains about his current logo.

Or, he might have understood the business owner better, clicked with him, and been able to persuade him to get a new logo that he’d appreciate even more than the previous one.

His intentions seemed pure enough to himself, and maybe they were (who am I to judge) 

But, without taking time to discover what the owner valued, his intentions were worth nada, zilch, nothing, 0.
 
(The intentions were actually more like a negative number because both the guy AND the business owner left the interaction more upset at one another than they were to begin with)

What a drag, right? 

Charlie Munger said “One of the best ways to learn from mistakes is to learn from the mistakes of others. Learning from others' mistakes is cost-free”

I love that quote. 

And maybe this story about the guy that pissed off a business owner and himself serves as a cost-free mistake for you too.

Till next time,
