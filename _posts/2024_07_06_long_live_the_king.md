# Betrayal is an Unavoidable Aspect of Life

I’ll bet even you have betrayed yourself in the past.

There’s no escaping it.

And because business is just another aspect of life…

…it MUST come with betrayal.

> “For there to be betrayal, there would have to have been trust first.”  
> ― Suzanne Collins, The Hunger Games

So what?

The point here is this…

Do not let fear of betrayal prevent you from appreciating the finer things in life…

From forging new relationships…

Experiencing the unknown…

Building others up…

Hearing others out…

Know that betrayal is as natural as your heart beating without your conscious assistance.

> “Et tu, Brute?”  
> ― William Shakespeare, Julius Caesar

And people betray one another all the time (sometimes without even understanding why):

- **Jesus and Judas**: Think about how Jesus was betrayed by Judas, one of his closest friends. Judas sold him out for thirty pieces of silver, leading to Jesus' arrest and crucifixion.
- **Joseph and His Brothers**: In the Hebrew Bible, Joseph's brothers were super jealous of him because he was their dad’s favorite. They sold him into slavery in Egypt, where he went through a lot of tough times.
- **Buddha and Devadatta**: Devadatta, the Buddha's cousin and disciple, was jealous and tried to take over the Buddhist community. He even made several attempts on the Buddha's life.
- **Rama and Kaikeyi**: In the epic Ramayana, Rama was betrayed by his stepmom, Kaikeyi, who wanted her son Bharata to be king. She used a promise from Rama's dad to send Rama into exile for fourteen years.
- **Scar and Mufasa in The Lion King**: Scar betrays his brother Mufasa in a power grab, orchestrating his death to become king.
  > “Long live the King.”  
  > Scar, The Lion King.
- **Saruman in The Lord of the Rings**: Saruman, once a leader of the wizards, betrays his allies by joining Sauron and attempting to take over Middle-earth for himself.
- **Anakin and Yoda in Star Wars**: Anakin’s turn to the dark side and transformation into Darth Vader was a betrayal to Yoda and the Jedi Order. Anakin's fall contributed significantly to the near destruction of the Jedi and the rise of the Galactic Empire.

Betrayal is a recurring theme in life.

It adds depth and conflict to your relationships and personal development.  
How you deal with betrayal is what you ought to be most interested in.

> “Everyone suffers at least one bad betrayal in their lifetime. It’s what unites us. The trick is not to let it destroy your trust in others when that happens. Don’t let them take that from you.”  
> ― Sherrilyn Kenyon, Invincible

If you’re frozen thinking, “What if they betray me? Oh I hope I don’t get betrayed! I hope they don’t hurt me!”  
Or thinking, “I’ll avoid betrayal by {insert delusion}”, then you’re out of alignment with reality.

You won’t have the room necessary to grow and experience the finer things in life.

Even the “bad” guys deal with betrayal.

- **Anakin Skywalker** felt betrayed by the Jedi Order, especially by Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi, because he believed they didn't trust him or recognize his potential. That sense of betrayal played a significant role in his fall to the dark side and transformation into Darth Vader.
- On the flip-side, **Yoda and the Jedi Order** were concerned that Anakin would turn to the dark side, yet they trained him up anyways.

Similar experiences, yet very different responses.

As I continue to grow my business, I meet new people from all over the world. I’m constantly faced with dealing with the potential of betrayal.  
And the thing is, it’s often camouflaged…  
The spirit of betrayal is not necessarily like a sparkling, lime-green creature that charges head on at you.  
It’s hidden.  
Unseen and unknown.  
And if you’re afraid of being hurt, you will close yourself off to everything and everyone and suffer and die.  
And if you’re naive, you will open yourself up to all sorts of catastrophe as well.

It’s a beautiful dance that you have to experience for yourself to really appreciate it.  
If you’re afraid, I have to be honest with you and let you know that I can’t give you a formula to eliminate betrayal 🤷‍♂️  
What I can do is leave you with these questions that may be useful for you (the last one has been the most useful for me):

- Do I acknowledge betrayal as a fact of life?
- Have I betrayed anyone?
- Have I betrayed myself?
- Do I judge betrayal as good or bad?
- How do I deal with betrayal?
- Am I afraid of betrayal?

I love you,

Canaan
