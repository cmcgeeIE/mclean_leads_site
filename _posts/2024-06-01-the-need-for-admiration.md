“He thought admiring others was a sign of weakness, a concession that someone else might be better than him.”

The city of Gladeus birthed killers. 
The mothers sang lullabies of superiority and victory,
To their children resting in cradles.
Coding their conscience for relentless achievement.
 
David of Gladeus, 
Believed he was the best. 
He vied for the pinnacle of dominance. 
Always setting his mind to conquer new challenges 
And often succeeding. 
His unwavering confidence became his defining trait
That served him well. 

“David, who in all of Gladeus is greater than you?” a thought whispered to his mind. 

Pausing for a moment, “I can think of none.” he said grinning. 

“And whom do you admire?” said the slithering thought.

“None!” proclaimed David. “To admire is to surrender!” 

He scoffed at the notion of admiring others, 
Believing it was a sign of weakness. 

The thought left, 
And David continued to ponder his response. 
His grin slowly transformed.
A subtle emptiness swelled within him 
That he couldn’t quite pinpoint. 

Days passed. 
Then months. 
Then years.
 
And rather than becoming greater, 
David appeared to shrink. . .

The people of Gladeus began to forget him
And he began to forget himself. 

His mind closed off to new ideas, 
And his heart grew heavy from isolation. 
His beliefs led him down 
A path of bitterness and stagnation. 
Stuck in a self-imposed prison of superiority. 

As if guided by fate, 
David stumbled into @ShaneParrish
-- Apprentice of Collins 
And philosopher renowned for his clarity of thought. 

Never in a 1,000 years,
Would David have “lowered” himself,
To ask for assistance
But, the pain of his imprisonment scraped away
Till his ego diminished enough
To allow room for growth.
 
“Parrish,” said David. 
“I’ve always believed in my own abilities,”
“That I can conquer anything I set my mind to.”
“But lately, I’ve felt,”

“Stuck. . . “

“Like I’ve hit a wall.”
“What am I missing?” 

Parrish nodded slowly, 
“Confidence,”
“Strong in you, it is”
“But alone, it serves not.”
“Tell me,”
“Admire others, do you?”

A wince of pain showed on David’s face, 
He furrowed his brow, 
Shaking his head,
“Admire others?”
“Admiration is weakness, is it not?”
“If I am the best, then. . .”
“Why would I look up to anyone other than I?”

Parrish smiled knowingly, 
Eyes twinkling, 
“Strength in others, you must see”
“Admiration not weakness,”
“But power, it is.”
“Counsel with greatness, you must.”

David leaned forward.
Confused, but intrigued. 
“But how would admiring someone else,”
“Make me stronger?”

“Admiration,” said Parrish. 
“Open your heart, it does.”
“Expand your mind, it will.”
“Learn from others, you must,”
“Growth comes from humility,”
“Not pride.”

David nodded slowly, 
Starting to understand
“So. . . ”
“By admiring others,”
“I can learn from their strengths,”
“And apply them to myself?”

“Yes” said Parrish
“Learn, you will.”
“Admire strength, creativity, courage.”
“Inspiration you will find.”
“Better you become, through others’ excellence.”

A small smiled formed on David’s face
“I think I’m beginning to understand”
“To truly be the best,”
“Is to constantly learn and grow.”

Paarrish grinned
His eyes gleaming
“Correct you are.”
“Endless is the journey of growth.”
“Admiration your guide it will be”
“Stronger, wiser you become.”

A crushing weight lifted from David’s back. 
He nodded with gratitude. 
“Thank you, Parrish.”
“I will begin looking for people to admire,”
“And let their strengths inspire me.”

Parrish nodded sagely.
“Good, that is”
“Admiration, your path to greatness it becomes”
“Role models, show me. Your future, I’ll show you.”


David walked away lighter
Brighter
His posture more upright 

He decided to embrace admiration.
He began to look at others not as rivals, 
But as sources of inspiration. 

He admired the rich man for his business acumen.
He admired the poet for his pen.
He admired the fighter for his bravery.
And the painter for her creativity. 

This shift in perspective opened new doors
And broadened his horizons. 
David began to see value in other's’ work
And how it could propel him forward. 

Admiration was no longer a soft concept for David
It became nuclear energy
He embraced it fully and let it drive him forward. 
He surrounded himself with people who inspired him, 
Learned from their strengths, 
And let his admiration propel him to new heights.
