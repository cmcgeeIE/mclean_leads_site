<p>“He thought admiring others was a sign of weakness, a concession that someone else might be better than him.”</p>

<p>The city of Gladeus birthed killers.<br>
The mothers sang lullabies of superiority and victory,<br>
To their children resting in cradles.<br>
Coding their conscience for relentless achievement.</p>

<p>David of Gladeus,<br>
Believed he was the best.<br>
He vied for the pinnacle of dominance.<br>
Always setting his mind to conquer new challenges<br>
And often succeeding.<br>
His unwavering confidence became his defining trait<br>
That served him well.</p>

<p>“David, who in all of Gladeus is greater than you?” a thought whispered to his mind.</p>

<p>Pausing for a moment, “I can think of none.” he said grinning.</p>

<p>“And whom do you admire?” said the slithering thought.</p>

<p>“None!” proclaimed David. “To admire is to surrender!”</p>

<p>He scoffed at the notion of admiring others,<br>
Believing it was a sign of weakness.</p>

<p>The thought left,<br>
And David continued to ponder his response.<br>
His grin slowly transformed.<br>
A subtle emptiness swelled within him<br>
That he couldn’t quite pinpoint.</p>

<p>Days passed.<br>
Then months.<br>
Then years.</p>

<p>And rather than becoming greater,<br>
David appeared to shrink. . .</p>

<p>The people of Gladeus began to forget him<br>
And he began to forget himself.</p>

<p>His mind closed off to new ideas,<br>
And his heart grew heavy from isolation.<br>
His beliefs led him down<br>
A path of bitterness and stagnation.<br>
Stuck in a self-imposed prison of superiority.</p>

<p>As if guided by fate,<br>
David stumbled into @ShaneParrish<br>
-- Apprentice of Collins<br>
And philosopher renowned for his clarity of thought.</p>

<p>Never in a 1,000 years,<br>
Would David have “lowered” himself,<br>
To ask for assistance<br>
But, the pain of his imprisonment scraped away<br>
Till his ego diminished enough<br>
To allow room for growth.</p>

<p>“Parrish,” said David.<br>
“I’ve always believed in my own abilities,”<br>
“That I can conquer anything I set my mind to.”<br>
“But lately, I’ve felt,”</p>

<p>“Stuck. . .”</p>

<p>“Like I’ve hit a wall.”<br>
“What am I missing?”</p>

<p>Parrish nodded slowly,<br>
“Confidence,”<br>
“Strong in you, it is”<br>
“But alone, it serves not.”<br>
“Tell me,”<br>
“Admire others, do you?”</p>

<p>A wince of pain showed on David’s face,<br>
He furrowed his brow,<br>
Shaking his head,<br>
“Admire others?”<br>
“Admiration is weakness, is it not?”<br>
“If I am the best, then. . .”<br>
“Why would I look up to anyone other than I?”</p>

<p>Parrish smiled knowingly,<br>
Eyes twinkling,<br>
“Strength in others, you must see”<br>
“Admiration not weakness,”<br>
“But power, it is.”<br>
“Counsel with greatness, you must.”</p>

<p>David leaned forward.<br>
Confused, but intrigued.<br>
“But how would admiring someone else,”<br>
“Make me stronger?”</p>

<p>“Admiration,” said Parrish.<br>
“Open your heart, it does.”<br>
“Expand your mind, it will.”<br>
“Learn from others, you must,”<br>
“Growth comes from humility,”<br>
“Not pride.”</p>

<p>David nodded slowly,<br>
Starting to understand<br>
“So. . .”<br>
“By admiring others,”<br>
“I can learn from their strengths,”<br>
“And apply them to myself?”</p>

<p>“Yes” said Parrish<br>
“Learn, you will.”<br>
“Admire strength, creativity, courage.”<br>
“Inspiration you will find.”<br>
“Better you become, through others’ excellence.”</p>

<p>A small smile formed on David’s face<br>
“I think I’m beginning to understand”<br>
“To truly be the best,”<br>
“Is to constantly learn and grow.”</p>

<p>Paarrish grinned<br>
His eyes gleaming<br>
“Correct you are.”<br>
“Endless is the journey of growth.”<br>
“Admiration your guide it will be”<br>
“Stronger, wiser you become.”</p>

<p>A crushing weight lifted from David’s back.<br>
He nodded with gratitude.<br>
“Thank you, Parrish.”<br>
“I will begin looking for people to admire,”<br>
“And let their strengths inspire me.”</p>

<p>Parrish nodded sagely.<br>
“Good, that is”<br>
“Admiration, your path to greatness it becomes”<br>
“Role models, show me. Your future, I’ll show you.”</p>

<p>David walked away lighter<br>
Brighter<br>
His posture more upright</p>

<p>He decided to embrace admiration.<br>
He began to look at others not as rivals,<br>
But as sources of inspiration.</p>

<p>He admired the rich man for his business acumen.<br>
He admired the poet for his pen.<br>
He admired the fighter for his bravery.<br>
And the painter for her creativity.</p>

<p>This shift in perspective opened new doors<br>
And broadened his horizons.<br>
David began to see value in others’ work<br>
And how it could propel him forward.</p>

<p>Admiration was no longer a soft concept for David<br>
It became nuclear energy<br>
He embraced it fully and let it drive him forward.<br>
He surrounded himself with people who inspired him,<br>
Learned from their strengths,<br>
And let his admiration propel him to new heights.</p>
