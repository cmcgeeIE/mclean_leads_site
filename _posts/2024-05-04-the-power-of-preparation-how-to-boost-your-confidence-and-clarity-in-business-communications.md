# Why Preparation Matters

Have you ever been caught off guard during a conversation or while writing an important email or text? 

I've been there—fumbling over my words, second-guessing my purpose, and leaving opportunities on the table. 

I want to show you  how getting prepared in advance will boost your confidence through the roof, reduce the amount of mistakes you make, and increase the likelihood of you getting what you want. 

And I’m going to show you what I mean by sharing a personal story of my own.  

# The Tale of Two Mindsets

Imagine two mindsets. In the first, you just get INTO stuff. You just go "Fuck it. Let's just do it and see what happens". 

That mindset is beautiful. It’s so helpful. So appreciated. It’s thrilling. It’s great for exploration.

But when it comes to certain things, that mindset can cause confusion and missed opportunities. It’s like a paradox because it opens opportunities, but by itself it can make you miss opportunities.

In the second mindset, you're prepared. Before you even do anything, you know what to say. Before you pick up the phone or start typing an email, you know what you want to say. The clarity transforms your approach. It makes each interaction more purposeful and boosts your confidence. 

These two mindsets, when balanced, create magic. If you don’t balance them, they create a mess.

Without further due, listen to this story about a time when my unpreparedness led to a mess, and how building up a prepared mindset changed everything.

# From Cringe to Confidence: A Personal Journey

When I first started cold calling for a client, I had no script and minimal direction. 

The instructions I was given were basically, “This is the kind of company we’re targeting. These are the traits we want them to have. Selling them is the easy part, but getting them to agree to a meeting is the hard part. That’s  your job.”

I didn’t know what I needed to say, or where exactly I wanted the call to go,  or how to end the call. And that made everything so much more stressful.

I would make calls and say the most generic things ever like “Hey, is this the owner of XYZ?” That opening right there would KILL me inside and the person I was on the phone with. I hated saying it, but I just did not know what else to say. 

And the listener would tense up on me so fast I could feel the cringe through the phone. I felt my posture turn into gollum off Lord of the Rings. I felt bad for even calling them, and most of them told me to kick rocks. 

I don’t blame them. I sounded like an amateur. 

But after getting kicked in the face a couple of times, I did some reflecting and studying and pieced up what it was exactly that I was trying to do, and started patching together a script for myself. 

I realized the opening was so crucial because if you can’t get past that, then what’s the point of anything else? I mean seriously, if you can’t even get past the greeting, then what are you doing? 

Then, I started to role play with myself, imagining how a conversation might go. So, instead of trying to hurry up and quickly get to what I wanted to say, and blasting past the initial engagement, trying to get a meeting --  I just focused on a solid opener. One thing at a time. 

I searched online for advice, and came across something like this, it’s not exact, but it’s something like this and I tailored it for myself. It went like this: 

“Hey this is Canaan, I’m gonna be honest with you, this is a cold call. Would you let me have 30 seconds of your time, or would you like me to kick rocks?” 

I thought that was so funny (and I still think that’s so funny) and direct, that I wrote it down for myself. Oh my god I love that opener because you’re not hiding or beating around the bush. 

You’re not trying to rush to the appointment. It’s just simple and honest. It’s perfect. So I wrote it down. 

Then, I thought to myself, “Ok, now they’re either just going to tell me to kick rocks, or they’re going to give me 30 seconds.” Thank GOD! Now the path has been clearly defined. You’re not wondering what’s gonna happen? What’s gonna happen?

Ok, so then I wondered, so if they give me 30 seconds, then what am I going to say? 🤔

Well, they’re probably going to want to know who I am exactly and why I’m calling. So, i started writing the script to address the obvious: 

I wrote down something like this, “My name’s Canaan, I’m with XYZ company, and the reason I’m calling is because we’re expanding our business into <region>, and we’re looking for potential partnerships with X companies” 

Then I paused. 

Now what? I timed myself and that took about 30 seconds to say. So I figured it’d be best to pause. Now, they’re either going to say, “Oh ok, now that I know what this is about I’m not interested.” Or “We already have someone that does that.” Or they’ll say something like “Ok…” Or ask me some questions. 

So then I thought, alright, if we make it that far, then I’m going to tell them that it’s been 30 seconds, would they like to hang up on me now, or would they give me another 60 seconds? 

Again, now you’re only dealing with 2 outcomes. They’re going to say yes or no. 

So I wrote down something like, “Well, it’s been 30 seconds, would you like to hang up on me or would you let me have 60 seconds to ask you a few questions to see if we might be a good fit?”

Then I wrote out all the pre-qualifying questions my client wanted, 

- How long have you been in business? 
- Does your business do this? 
- Do you have someone that does this? 
- Are you interested in this service? 

All those questions that would make the actual sales meeting make sense, I wrote down and made it MY purpose for the call. Like, hey, my purpose is to call these people and see if they might be a good fit. That’s it. Plain and simple. 

And then, again either they’d disqualify themselves or we’d move on to scheduling a date to meet up. So I wrote out again, “Ok great. It looks like we might be a good fit. Our owner is going to be in town these days, would you be available to meet at this time or this time?

Ok great. I’ll send you a calendar invite soon. Thanks for your time.”

And guys, before I even started using the script, I felt 100x better. Having a cleared out path of WHAT I wanted to say and WHERE I wanted to go was a HUGE confidence booster for me. 

Oh my god my posture shot up and the idea of cold calling just became like any other task. Just like wiping tables, seating guests, cleaning dishes, cutting brisket, whatever other job you’ve ever had where you had clear instructions to use, cold calling became like that. 

And you can already guess what happened? I started having a blast! Folks were cracking up at the opener, they appreciated the effort,the cringe faded away, AND I started booking more meetings. 

My appointment rate shot up by like 300%. I felt like the man. Just clocking in and handling business. And I met some great people and had great conversations and made my client happy because he was getting all these meetings. It was a blast. 

The thing is, this isn't just about cold calling; the principle applies universally. Whether it's sales emails, difficult conversations, or networking—preparation is key.

If you’re looking to balance out your spontaneous personality, here’s my recommendations: 

# Draft a Clear Script: Start with a direct opener that sets the tone and intention of the conversation.

- Ask for a Specific Amount of Time

- Plan for Responses

- Role-play the conversation

# Why This Works: The Psychological Edge
Writing things down and preparing in advance does more than just outline a strategy; it solidifies your commitment, and it calms your mind. 

The act of writing converts your strategy into a commitment, which psychologically prepares you to execute the plan effectively. 

This preparation reduces anxiety and boosts your confidence, allowing you to focus on the interaction instead of worrying about what to say next.
