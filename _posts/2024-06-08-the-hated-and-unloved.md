Your blood bubbles like bacon fat because you believe a lie. 

The lie plugs your pores. 

Leading to infection and pussing up inside your soul. 

Youâ€™re very much aware of the pain.

But rather than seek its source. . . 

You took flight, searching for relief. 

Sought out distraction.

Pain killers.

Anything to avoid sitting still and suffering. 

The truth is. . . 

There is an entity within you.

Lurking in the shadows.

Orchestrating your thoughts. 

Puppetting your actions. 

Abusing your self-esteem. 

Leaching your life energy. 

Elevating you higher. 

To bring you lower. 

It will remain in you.  

It will grow. 

It will compound.

Own you. 

Unless you explore your inner-plumbing. . . 

Will you pop open the manhole, and plunge into your sewer system? 

That place where the worst of you exists.

That place of filth and obscurity, 

Where you hide the things you wished were untrue.

Where black figures with red eyes and purple auras buckle knees and melt backbones.

Do not be afraid. 

That is where you rediscover the missing pieces of you. 

The neglected foundation that keeps you from evaporating back into nothingness.   

Shine your light on that hated and unloved place.
