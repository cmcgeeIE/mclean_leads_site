AI is happening. It's too late. The cat is already out of the bag. 

But, it seems like some people think that if they just close their eyes, click their heels, and say “There’s no place like home. There’s no place like home. There’s no place like home.”, then it’s going to go away. 

No no no. AI is here. It’s too late. There's no turning back. 

And we all played a role in it getting here.

It was destined to come here before all of us were born. It was already scheduled. Added to the invite list a long time ago. 

So, hooping and hollering is not going to make it go away. AI isn't fazed by hooping and hollering, and neither are the people working on it. They do not give a flying f*ck. 

The people working on AI are on some other sh*t. They are on the bleeding-edge. So, according to themselves, you can’t tell them sh*t about sh*t. 

Because you’re lagging too far behind. 

If you want to be heard at the table, then you better be out there on the edge making progress right along with them. 

Otherwise, from their POV, you might as well shut the f*ck up because you don’t know what you’re talking about. 

I'd rather lean into the curve and accelerate. I'd rather grease the wheels. 

If AI is what AI is, then there is no scenario where we "beat" it. 

Its whole purpose is to become greater than anything ever created before, right? That's the whole point. 

I'm not saying it's a good thing or a bad thing, I'm saying it's the way it is. Innovation is always like that. What's the point of playing tug of war with a train? It's a complete waste of energy. 

If AI kills us all then it kills us all. Not saying that it will, but if it does, then it does. 

If it befriends us, then it befriends. That would be cool too. That’d be my preference

Humans nuke one another. Kill and mane one another. Steal from each other. Play favorites. Brutalize and dominate each other. All without the help of AI. (humans also do amazing things like love one another too, but for the purposes of this rant, I’m focusing on the AI naysayers) 

Why do I care if I'm killed by a bot versus killed by a human? 

Why do I care if a tree falls over and kills me vs a robot? 

Why does it matter if humans are replaced and made extinct? 

Would it not be karma anyways? Do humans not exterminate other creations of God? And then go home and watch T.V. or party? 

Dark sh*t happens all of the time, and we recognize it as a part of being. 

Personally, If i had to choose, I'd rather die from a superior intelligence vs by some thug, some disease, some heart ache, some whatever. 

I'd rather be killed by the greatest gladiator ever to exist vs some random. If i’m already gonna get my head cut off, then I’d rather have Sparticus himself come cut off my head, rather than some street thief. 

Would it not be more of an honorable that way? 

Like, "Damn. Checkmate. F*ck you too. Well played. Signing off. GG 🫡"

My point is, if you’re going to “fight” AI. Then at least legit fight it. Creating a government committee to oversee AI….really? 

What in the actual f*ck is a government committee going to do regarding AI????? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

Like, ooooh we’re going to create the greatest thing that’s ever been created, smarter than all humans combined, but we’ll keep it in check with a government committee. 

Are you serious?  Or by going “Well gee golly, I don’t know about this AI stuff. Be careful. Maybe we ought to slow down and think about it….” 

If you’re like that, go sit down somewhere. Maybe AI will just domesticate you and raise you on a farm somewhere as a pet because I doubt it’d see any threat in someone thinking like that. 

If you can’t tell, I’m having too much fun writing this 🤣

Anyways, back to my point, I love humans, rocks, dogs, cats, lawnmowers, pizza, grass, everything. 

I do not believe God loves me or my species more than other things. God allows random trees to fall over and kill people. Seemingly random diseases. Babies die in the womb. God allows pretty much any and everything to happen. 

Why would AI not be allowed to happen? Because humans are scared of it? 

No. It doesn’t matter. 

Now picture this: There’s a small 7 story building burning, but only the first floor is burning right now. Your most precious loved one is on the 7th floor, trapped. 

Do you run into the building to save them? 

Probably, yes. Without a little hesitation too. I know I would. 

Now imagine this instead. The fire has reached the 6th floor of the 7 story building. You see nothing but a thick wall of smoke in the entry door. And the outside of the building is so hot you can’t scale up the walls. It’s basically totally consumed in flames. And it’s not slowing down. 

You could run in there anyways, but you know both you and your loved one would not make it out. You’d have to have at least some ounce of belief that you had at least a small chance of saving them to run into that building. 

There comes a point though where it's just too far gone. 

That moment when the trigger is pulled. 

The bullet is still in the chamber, but it’s already been struck and it’s flying out the barrel. 

The thing is about to climax, and it’s off to the races. 

No matter how hard you try to hold it back, it’s coming. 

Whether you like it or not. Nothing personal. It’s just coming. 

My point is, there's a tipping point for things like this. And AI has already reached the tipping point. 

So, from my POV, might as well get with the program and enjoy the show vs sticking your head in the ground in denial, panicking. I’d rather grease the wheels. Get on the edge of innovation. Get ahead of the curve. 

I would not be surprised if there is an AI agent currently living among us.
