Staring down the barrel of a 14-day email warm-up period, there I was. First thought? "Damn…”

In a world where two-day shipping feels like an eternity (like getting caught in Gojo’s Infinite Void or Itachi’s Tsukuyomi ), waiting two weeks for an email server to get its act together felt like a sick joke. 

My next thought: "Can I throw money at this problem?" Spoiler alert: You cannot. 

This left me with two options: I could sit and stew in my impatience, or I could find something else to do in the meantime. 

That "something else," meant diving headfirst into the world of ancient texts and technology. 

Why? Because nothing says "productive use of downtime" like exploring how folks used to operate before the invention of the spam folder.

I ended up digging into everything from the Book of Enoch, Jubilees, the Emerald Tablets of Thoth, to the Enuma Elish. It was like swapping a waiting room for a time machine. 

And let me tell you, ancient texts are the original binge-worthy content. Plenty of wisdom and intrigue to keep the pages turning.

What struck me most was this realization: Our ancestors were out of this world.

They understood that life isn’t just about ticking boxes or clearing inboxes. It's about connection, perception, and the soul's journey. 

It made me see the waiting game in a whole new light. Instead of pacing the floor over email servers, I found myself pondering life’s bigger question, like why where we came from and what it all means.

Rather than being anxious, it feels like being on a spiritual retreat. 

Who knew that a forced break from digital hustling could turn into a crash course in philosophy, technology,  and ancient wisdom?

So, to anyone out there drumming their fingers, waiting for something—anything—to happen, here's my unsolicited advice: Dig into something wildly unrelated to whatever you're waiting on. 

The more seemingly disconnected, the better. Trust me, God has a sense of humor, and sometimes, it puts you on “hold” just to show you there’s more to life than loading screens and progress bars.

To wrap this up, remember: Waiting doesn’t have to be wasted time. It can be an unexpected journey. Or at the very least, a chance to read up on some ancient wisdom that might just make you the most interesting person at your next get together. 

In the meantime, I'm back to waiting on things—because some things never change. But now, I've got ancient insights to keep me company. And I wouldn't have it any other way.
